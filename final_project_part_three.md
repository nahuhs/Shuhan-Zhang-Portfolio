## Improvements
1. I restructured the whole story. Previously, I spent a lot of time introducing the effect and increasing usage of social media, without diving directly into influencer marketing. For the final story, I started with only one small introduction of how the growing usage of social media provides new opportunities for brands and companies to promote their products and services. Then, I focused on describing three main components of influencer marketing: influencers, social media platforms, and followers' attitudes. Later, I also gave call-to action suggestions from these three perspectives.
2. For influencer part, I introduced four different types of influencer, which are basically defined by their follower size. One interesting fact I pointed out here is that having more followers does not mean more engagement rate of their contents. This links to call-to action part. I also summarized several benefits of influencer marketing, and provide visualizations of the rapid growing global market size of influencer marketing, suggesting companies and brands who want to promote their products or services to have a try on influencer marketing.
3. For social media platforms, I provided one visualization showing the social media platforms ranked by their monthly active users. Having more user means more opportunities. Also, I provided another visualization showing the most frequently used social media platform for influencer marketing is Instagram, and also provided reason for this trend.
4. For follower attitude, I provided visualizations of a survey results asking respondants about how they see influencer marketing. This part will also gain some insights for influencer campagin maker. I also resonated this part in the call-to action section.
5. I added more details and resources in the call-to action section, in order to make this part as compelling as possible. The three quick link buttons can provide social media marketer quick access to the resources they want.
6. I deleted extra YouTube videos, but to present them in words or visualizations.
7. For visualizations, I used some from part II, and incorporated with some new data I found online and more relevant to the topics. I figured the key of speaking a compelling story is not about the amount of visualizations, but the relevancy and credibility of these data visualization plots. 
8. The flow for the final project is definitely clearer than the previous versions. I used narratives, research summaries and data visualizations to make the whole story informative and useful for my target audiences. 

## Target Audience
The target audience is still the same as from part II. I hope to reach companies, brands or people who are exploring influencer marketing as an approach to do online digital marketing to promote their services or products. I hope my analysis can put up some online scattering information together, and provide them a concise but comprehensive picture of how influencer marketing works, the benefits, the potential risks and some resources they can utilize to make better influencer marketing strategies. Also, target audience can also be people who are interested in the topic of influencer marketing and want to learn more. This project will also provide them with some additional analysis and resources they can refer to.
