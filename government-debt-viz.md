## The Gird of Line Charts
In order to track and compare the trend of government debt for different countries through 1995 to 2021, a grid of line charts is to better show the comparison.

## The Box Plot
The side by side box plot is to better show the overall distribution of the yearly government debt data for each country from 1995 to 2021. From this plot, we can easily see which countries have a smaller overall amount of  government debt and which have a fairly larger amount of government debt. I named this plot as *"Japan - Noticeable High Government Debt"*, since Japan shows to have the highest median and maximum value of government debt, as well as a wide spread distribution of debt over the years.
