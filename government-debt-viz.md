# Visualization of Government Debt

## Plot One - The original Bar Chart by OECD

## Plot Two - The Gird of Line Charts
In order to track and compare the trend of government debt for different countries through 1995 to 2021, a grid of line charts is to better show the comparison.

## Plot Three - The Box Plot
The side by side box plot is to better show the overall distribution of the yearly government debt data for each country from 1995 to 2021. From this plot, we can easily see which countries have a smaller overall amount of  government debt and which have a fairly larger amount of government debt. I named this plot as *"Japan - Noticeable High Government Debt"*, since Japan shows to have the highest median and maximum value of government debt, as well as a wide spread distribution of debt over the years.

## Comparison and Summary
The comparison between these plots are pretty obvious here. For the bar chart, it is easier to see the ranking of countries with the highest to lowest government debt for a specific year or a specific period of years. From the grid of line charts, it is easier to see the trend of government debt of each individual country and also the comparison between them. For the box plot I chose, it allows us to see the overall distribution of the government debt and make direct comparison between these countries since they are on the same layout. The box plot consists of statistical information which might be useful for statistical analysis in the future.
