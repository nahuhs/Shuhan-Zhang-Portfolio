# About Me
Hi! My name is Shuhan Zhang, a current graduate student at CMU. I studied Statistics and Mathematics during my undergrad, and now I am pursuing a master degree in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. Through my previous experience, I realized that making data insights persuasive is as important as building useful models. I hope you all can enjoy the work I created here, and welcome any feedbacks.

# What I hope to learn
As a future data scientist, I hope to cultivate my sense of creating attractive as well as intuitive data visualizations, so that I can better communicate data with my clients, stakeholders and people in other domain. I want to make it easier for other people to interpret the result of my work and quickly get the point of the data I am trying to present. 

This [Cosmic Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Calendar) plot once gave me a huge knock of how one good visualization plot can help people understand complicated and opaque concepts and knowledge. Please click it and enjoy!
