### Deep Dive into the Instagram advertising

I am still trying to find data and information which could show the huge revenue and ads reach rate on Instagram. Probably will include a geographic map which shows ads reach rate across the world or constrained to the U.S.

### So, what are people's attitudes towards social marketing?

Here is a survey asking for respondants' attitude towards influencer marketing. People holds various kinds of attitudes towards influencer marketing. We notice that negative repsonses takes some amount of percentage.

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1664853728265');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);

Besides the data viz, I will also include some debate blogs or videos to present a more in-depth arguements around social media or influencer marketing.

### Is social media marketing all good? What are the potential cons?

### Call to Actions
1. Focus on the main social media platforms to distribute marketing ads, like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.
2. Gather user feedbacks frequently to see what are the attitudes towards social media marketing or influencer marketing. Making relative strategies to distribute the proper amount of ads to proper influencers posts or videos is a key element to avoid negative user feedback.
3. Some strategies on how to find the appropriate influencers for social media marketing is crucial, because brands reputation can become vulnarable sometimes depending on the influencer. (Embed one YouTube Video I saw could be useful).

## User Research

**1. The target audience I hope to reach with my story**

The target audience I hope to reach to are either commercials, brands, companies or individuals who want to explore social media platform as an approach to do online digital marketing to promote their services or products, or people who are interested in the topic of social media marketing/influencer marketing and want to learn more.

**2. The approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**

To identify the target audience, the first thing I did is to look from people around me. 

I picked candidate A who is going to become a product manager after graduation. This individual is representative in the way that being a product manager is responsible for the whole cycle of product development, including marketing and promoting products, and this is probably where social media marketing strategy kicks in. 

I picked candidate B who is super interested in influencer marketing and is currently preparing to create her own YouTube channel to become an influencer. I believe she will provide me some ideas on the aspects of social media marketing which I missed talking about. 

I picked candidate C who previously had experience as a marketing specialist and had exposure to soial media marketing. I believe she can provide me some insights and feedbacks on what a social media marketer wants to see from my story.
