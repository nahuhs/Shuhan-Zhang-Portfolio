### Deep Dive into the Instagram advertising

I am still trying to find data and information which could show the huge revenue and ads reach rate on Instagram. Probably will include a geographic map which shows ads reach rate across the world or constrained to the U.S.

### So, what are people's attitudes towards social media marketing?

Here is a survey asking for respondants' attitude towards influencer marketing. People holds various kinds of attitudes towards influencer marketing. We notice that negative repsonses takes some amount of percentage.

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1664853728265');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

Besides the data viz, I will also include some debate blogs or videos to present a more in-depth arguements around social media or influencer marketing.

### Is social media marketing all good? What are the potential cons?

### Call to Actions
1. Focus on the main social media platforms to distribute marketing ads, like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.
2. Gather user feedbacks frequently to see what are the attitudes towards social media marketing or influencer marketing. Making relative strategies to distribute the proper amount of ads to proper influencers posts or videos is a key element to avoid negative user feedback.
3. Some strategies on how to find the appropriate influencers for social media marketing is crucial, because brands reputation can become vulnarable sometimes depending on the influencer. (Embed one YouTube Video I saw could be useful).

## User Research

**1. The target audience I hope to reach with my story**

The target audience I hope to reach to are either commercials, brands, companies or individuals who want to explore social media platform as an approach to do online digital marketing to promote their services or products, or people who are interested in the topic of social media marketing/influencer marketing and want to learn more.

**2. The approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**

To identify the target audience, the first thing I did is to look from people around me. 

I picked candidate A who is going to become a product manager after graduation. This individual is representative in the way that being a product manager is responsible for the whole cycle of product development, including marketing and promoting products, and this is probably where social media marketing strategy kicks in. 

I picked candidate B who is super interested in influencer marketing and is currently preparing to create her own YouTube channel to become an influencer. I believe she will provide me some ideas on the aspects of social media marketing which I missed talking about. 

I picked candidate C who previously had experience as a marketing specialist and had exposure to soial media marketing. I believe she can provide me some insights and feedbacks on what a social media marketer wants to see from my story.

**3. My interview script**
Firstly, I go over the wireframes and introduce the story to each one of the candidates.

Secondly, candidates had the chance to ask any questions they may have while listening to my presentation.

Thirdly, I asked each one of the candidates the following questions.

1. What is your main takeaway from this story?
2. What is some additional thoughts or ideas you have while listening to the story?
3. Do you feel you can understand each of the data visualizations quickly and clearly?
4. What do you like the most about the story?
5. What do you think is the part that needs the most to be revised?
6. Do you think this story or data analysis and visualization here can help form marketing strategies?

**4. The findings from my interview**

1. Candidates think this story is well-connected in covering a whole picture of social media marketing, especially the call to actions part is useful. However, it would be better if the call to actions part can be expanded and be more specific. For example, what is the social media marketing strategy suggestions for small to medium size company, how do they differ from large size company? What are the performance metrics to look at when determining which influencer to use.
2. One candidate mentions that the color used in my visualizations for the tree plot is kind of ambiguous and misleading. So, be careful when use colors.
3. For the bar chart showing different social media platforms chosen to be the influencer marketing place, one candidate suggested that it took a while to understand the content because these two bar charts look alike. Probably I can put these two bar charts into one big side-by-side bar chart and ranked these platforms based on 2021 data to intuitively show the increasing trend of some social media platform like TikTok.
4. When talking about different social media platforms, I can add their icons into the visualizations.
5. For the pie chart showing the share of social media advertising among all the digital advertising in 2022, one candidate suggested to put another pie chart on the left to show the share of social media advertising in year 2010. This can help audience understand the huge increment of social media advertising share from 2010 to 2022.
6. One candidate suggested me to use narratives rather than descriptive sentences to connect the whole story. She mentioned that the sentences I put here on the wireframes are too plain or too descriptive to connect all the parts as a whole story.

**5. The changes I plan on implementing to my visualizations next week**
1. Be more careful about the color I will use.
2. Add social media platforms icons when possible.
3. Add one more pie chart to show the increment of the social media advertising share among all the digital advertising between year 2010 and 2022.
4. Fix the bar chart.
5. Add more details in call to actions section. 
6. Use narratives to connect the whole story. Give explanation or the angle of analysis when needed.
